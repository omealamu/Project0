            <h2>Fjord</h2>
            <p>Fjord is described as the strong silent type , and he tends to keep a cool and rational outlook. He is
                also very charismatic. Though willing to break rules when needed , he seems to operate under certain
                principles of honor, claiming that he tries to be honest and he thinks people should do what they say they're
                going to do. However, when he raised the question with his other party members of whether they would
                hijack a caravan, Fjord told the thievery-prone Nott that he didn't want to change her behavior to be more
                lawful and that he might take her up on the offer to learn how to steal. Fjord is also adept at acting,
                having used his talents in changing his voice and accent and his magical abilities to alter his appearance
                to get the party out of multiple sticky situations. Despite using a "country" accent (United States
                Texan English) around the other party members, he dropped the accent for a dream with his warlock patron
                ; this was confirmed as intentional by Travis, which suggests that Fjord is hiding his true accent from
                his companions.</p>
